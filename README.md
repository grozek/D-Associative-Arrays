Project: Mini-project-4: Associated Array
12/15/2023

This project contains a few files, and one of these contain primarly my own contributions:
- AssociativeArray.java
That simply creates implementation of AssociativeArray.

The other file where my coding efforts can be seen is 
- AssociativeArrayTests.java
which contians not only my submissions of tests (GabrielaRoznawskaTest01-03) but also those of my classmates

The submission also contains code created by prof. Samuel Rebelsky
-AssociativeArrayExperiments.java
-KeyNotFoundException.java
-KVPait.java
-ReportingAssociativeArray.java

I would like to acknowledge prof. Rebelsky for, as always, being an amazing resource when looking for help in understanding topics such as AssociatedArrays
I would also like to recognize Pom Dao's effors that helped me to direct implementation of Associated Arrays
